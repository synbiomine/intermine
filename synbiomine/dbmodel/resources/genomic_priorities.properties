# priority for fields declared in superclass are not overridden by different order in subclass
# e.g. identfier and organism always have priority as defined in BioEntity

# For example, to give interpro prioritiy over uniprot for the 'shortName' field of ProteinDomain:

BioEntity.organism = *, uniprot, go-annotation, nicolas2012-GEOSeries-Bsub168, faith-GEOSeries-EcoliK12
# BioEntity.organism = *

ProteinDomain.shortName = interpro, uniprot, *
