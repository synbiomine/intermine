#contains only classes that come from more than one source
#for each class contained every source for that class must be listed

# priority for fields declared in superclass are not overridden by different order in subclass
# e.g. identfier and organism always have priority as defined in BioEntity

# For example, to give interpro prioritiy over uniprot for the 'shortName' field of ProteinDomain:
#

BioEntity.organism = *, uniprot, go-annotation, nicolas-Bsub168-GEOSeries, jozefczuk-EcoliK12-GEOSeries

ProteinDomain.shortName = interpro, uniprot, *

Gene.primaryIdentifier = *, pubmed-gene, ncbi-gene
Gene.secondaryIdentifier = *
Gene.name = *
Gene.length = *
#Gene.organism = *, nicolas-Bsub168-GEOSeries
# NcRNA.primaryIdentifier = ecogene, ecogene-gene-fasta, pubmed-gene, *
# NcRNA.secondaryIdentifier = ecogene, *
# NcRNA.name = ecogene, *
